Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Hey
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Walking round’ in reality
I’m so done, done
Feel like I’m losing my gravity
My vision
Of you that I see clearly in my mind
I’m so you
My thoughts collide in my mind
I know I really should try
To think, to think
On my own but oh -
We’re tied together, it’s true
I think I’m becoming you
Don’t blink, don’t blink
(I-I)
They’re asking who
Took me so far away, far away
Digitally recreate everything
I wanna show you why I ~
[Parallel we rise]
Love it
Chk-Chk-Boom
Chronic, Chronic, Chronic
Collide till we go atomic
Turn it, turn it, turn it to a different space,
different wave
Want it, want it, want it
Opposites go supersonic
Love it love it love it
Dive into the fate we made
Sometimes I think you’re here, yeah you’re my
only one
You make it feel so real, outside it’s so
bizarre
Devastation and creation ooh ~
I’ll be your shooting star
A new perspective of life
While I just survive
I know, I know
We’re not going down
I guess I can’t compromise
The in between of our lives
I know, I know
(I-I)
You must be who
Took me so far away, far away
Digitally recreate everything
I~
Wanna show you why I ~
[Parallel we rise]
Love it
Chk-Chk-Boom
Chronic, Chronic, Chronic
Collide till we go atomic
Turn it, turn it, turn it to a different space,
different wave
Want it, want it, want it
Opposites go supersonic
Love it love it love it
Dive into the fate we made
Whisper
Come take me right away
Whisper
Merging right into you
[oh my]
Whisper
Me and my only
Press and hold onto continue
It’ll always be you
Tell me you won’t go away
Imagining maybe one day
That we’ll meet in between
Organic life and blue screens
I do
Need you
Mirror on the wall say
You’ll take me so far ~
(Far~!)
[Far Oh ~]
[Oh~!]
[T-T-Turn it, turn it, turn it to a different
space, different wave~]
[Opposites go supersonic uh ~]
Whisper
Come take me right away
Whisper
Merging right into you
[oh my]
Whisper
Me and my only
Press and hold onto continue
It’ll always be you
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
