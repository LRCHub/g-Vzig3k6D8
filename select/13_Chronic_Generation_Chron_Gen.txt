I'm a member of the Chronic Generation
It's gettin me nowhere-its full of complications
Our lives are moulded like a plasticene mutation
Don't wanna be a part of the Chronic Generation

CHRONIC GENERATION (CHRONIC GENERATION)
CHRONIC GENERATION (CHRONIC GENERATION)
CHRONIC GENERATION

Chronic Generation
Boredom and frustration
For the vandalisation
Of the infant school invasion

Chronic Generation
We rebel against the nation
And the system of education
The need for qualifications
